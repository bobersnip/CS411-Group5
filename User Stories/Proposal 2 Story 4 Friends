As a logged in user I should be able to search for other users and follow them. When I search for another user, I should be able to view their profile, 
which would contain things such as the recipes they like, maybe their favorite ingredients(?), as well as other miscellaneous information, 
such as their name/username and perhaps a self-written bio. I should also be able to view a list of the people I follow, 
as well as the people that are following me. I also want to be able to share any dishes that I find tasty or interesting with my friends. 
Also, if i can share an image of a dish that i made so that people that follow me can see those photos and potentially like and comment on them 
and see the original recipe used in the image.
