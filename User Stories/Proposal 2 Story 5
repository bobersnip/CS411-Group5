The users should have a groceries list, a pantry list, a tried recipes history, and a page to their profile information. 
The groceries list and pantry list could be accessed from the profile page and edited from the profile page. 
They should be able to delete and add ingredients in both lists. 
The tried recipes history page is a list of all the recipes the user has marked as tried before. 
They can change their rating for these recipes in this list. 
The user’s profile page should show their user information and a clickable list of their friends (which would lead them to their friends’ profile pages).
