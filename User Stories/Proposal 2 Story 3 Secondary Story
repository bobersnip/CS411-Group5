The ingredients that are used in the recipe should be displayed near the top of the recipe page. 
The ingredients that the user already has should be listed first and then the ingredients that the user doesn’t have should be listed separately. 
The app should mark the ingredients the user has in black, and the ones they don’t have in red. 
The missing ingredients are clickable so they can see their price and be able to add all missing ingredients into a groceries list.
Sub-story:
On their profile page, the user should have a groceries list for items that they do not have in their pantry list. 
The user should be able add groceries to that list from the profile page and also add them from recipe pages (mentioned above). 
The user should also be able to delete items or mark them as bought. If the items in the groceries list are marked as bought, 
the items will be deleted from the groceries list and added to the pantry list on refresh.
