Why we chose our tech stack (Python, Flask, HTML, MySQL):
	During the course of deciding which languages/programs to use we considered Python with Flask or Node and Java. However, after
we discussed amongst ourselves we discovered that nearly our entire group was already familiar with Python and Flask, which we decided to go
with it. Naturally, flask integrates with HTML, which is why we were required to use HTML. Lastly, we had to decide what kind of database we 
were going to use. We considered MySQL, PostGresSQL, and MongoDB. Ultimately, we decided on MySQL because three of our five group members were
already proficient in MySQL based on their knowledge from CS460.
